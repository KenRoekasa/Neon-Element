# Mechanics

## Tasks
    - Enemy class can only be ai not player controlled enemies. Sort this out
    - Improve players from walking into each other and getting stuck into each other
    - Dealing damage to other players with damage calculation
    - Sends things to the server
    - Changing States to be added
    - Integrate with Server
    - Integrate with UI


## Ideas
    - Have the aiController that controls a Player object rather than being an entities its self
    - Player will be tagged enemies, opponents, ai controlled etc...
    - Everything will happen client side first and then confirmed by the server. Which then syncs all the game clients to be like server game state
