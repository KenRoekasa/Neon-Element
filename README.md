# Do not forget
- Threads need to be killed properly and gracefully 

# Mechanics
## Tasks
- Integrate with Server
- Integrate with UI
- Fix collision bug
- Cooldown is not very polished apparently
  - cooldown is wayyyy to slow for light attacks
- make ai attacks speed limited, whilst player attacks should be uncapped
- Make more game modes
## Ideas
- Everything will happen client side first and then confirmed by the server. Which then syncs all the game clients to be like server game state
    - Will probably change
- When you die become a ghost that doesn't collide with anyone but can spectate, opacity turned down

# Renderer
## Tasks
- Improve performance by calculating relative locations once per tick
- Make things look nice
